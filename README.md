## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths
One of my strengths is styling with CSS

### Weaknesses
One of my weaknesses is React and class components

### Opportunities
This project will give me the opportnity to sharpen my skills in React 

### Threat
If I get stuck I tend to try and work on the same issue for a long time without asking for help. I'll make sure to ask more questions and avoid spending too much time on a project.
